# Kuracoin_blockchain

The internet needs a way to assign value and transfer this value. This blockchain helps us store that value. How do we pay a blogger $0.0001 as a thank-you token after reading a blog post? 
How do we buy and sell things in a borderless manner?

# Development 
Everyone is welcome to contribute, the *master* branch has the latest code. There will be version branches, for example, V1, V2, v3. 
Developers who frequently contribute to the software will receive tokens from the network as they have invested their time and energy into building the system.

Windows
- Clone the repo
- run deploy.bat ( This will build the code and launch 4 servers [localhost:100, localhost:200, localhost:300, localhost:400] that will connect, creating a test network.
- Send a TCP message to create a wallet using `localhost:100` 

# Testing
There are two types of tests that we run, they are manual testing and automated testing. Developers can check out the latest builds spawn various servers,
and make requests to them. Developers can also write tests and push them as proposals to the Lid development team.
