# Kura Coin

The internet needs a way to assign value and transfer this value. This blockchain helps us store that value. How do we pay a blogger $0.0001 as a thank-you token after reading a blog post?
How do we buy and sell things in a borderless manner?

Only 99.9 trillion coins exist and will ever exist. Miners are welcome to mine, we are using a proof of stake mechanism, where everyone is treated equially. All miners get paid for each transaction.
